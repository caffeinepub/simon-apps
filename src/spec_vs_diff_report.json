GitHub icon/link removal in ContactSection is implied by the react-icons import change and the updated component summary, but the relevant JSX is truncated so it can’t be fully verified from the snippet. The diff also includes unrequested HeroSection visual/styling changes and updates to project metadata/summary files beyond the requested copy/link removal.",
