# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refresh landing page copy in the Hero and Services sections, and remove the GitHub (cat) social link from the Contact section.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Hero headline text to exactly: "Let's build your Business app".
- Update the Hero subtitle text to exactly: "Deploy and host on the Internet Computer blockchain for next-level security and scalability".
- Update the Services section intro paragraph to exactly: "Simon Apps builds custom applications for small and businesses, designed to fit the way you work."
- Remove the GitHub icon/link from the "Connect with me" social links while keeping X and LinkedIn unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see the updated Hero and Services copy, and the Contact section no longer shows a GitHub social link (X and LinkedIn remain).
